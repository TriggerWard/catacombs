# TriggerWarding - Nillian Contracts

This package contains code & files relating to the Nillion chain. Nada contracts can be found & edited here

## Overview

Due to the mixed dependencies & set up from Nillion's boilerplate, this codebase contains both Hardhat & Foundry.

For the most part, we will make of Foundry's `forge` commands.

## Getting Started 👩‍💻

First we need to run the command to initiallize the Python virtual environment.

This can be achieved with the command:

```bash
bash create-venv.sh && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once there, navigate into the `cd next-project-programs` folder.

Here you can create your Nada contracts. To compile, run `nada build`
